Welcome to the _MakerManager_ User Guide! Choose a topic from the Table of Contents below, get step-by-step instructions, and develop makerspace management skills.
If you are a first time visitor, we suggest you follow this short document top-to-bottom to get the most out of it.

== Introduction
MakerManager is a free, open-source, desktop application for managing time-shared equipment in makerspaces.
If you are a lab manager, you can use MakerManager to update, add, remove and maintain your 3D printers and their print queues easily.
If you are a maker, you can use MakerManager to add, remove, update prints manually or automatically to one of several 3D printers available.
MakerManager aims to bridge a gap to let makers and managers coordinate effectively and efficiently - so you can worry less about availability and spend more time hacking!

MakerManager is meant for makers, and thus is optimized for people comfortable with a Command Line Interface (CLI).
This guide gives you a brief overview about setting-up and using MakerManager. MakerManager v1.4 is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux.

Still with us? Great! Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!

// end::intro[]

== Quick Start
This section shows you how to fire up MakerManager and get a feel of how to use it.

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed on your Computer. If you don't have JRE installed, you can use https://docs.oracle.com/goldengate/1212/gg-winux/GDRAD/java.htm#BGBFJHAB[this link] as a reference.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the jar file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your MakerManager.
. Double-click on the jar file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
+

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

=== User Interface Pointers

image::MarkedUi.png[align="left" width="790" ]

* The Command Box is at the top, with the prompt `Enter Command here`
* The panel below the Command Box gives you useful text-based output after every input.
* `1. oldupbox`, `2. ultimaker`, `3. mbot` and such columns represent machines
* The scrollable panel under each machine represents the machine's queue, with Print Jobs divided by alternating shades of grey.
* The tags are self-explanatory, but you can read the next section for getting a good understanding of what they represent.
+

+

[NOTE]
====
image::loginblue.PNG[width="790"]
The UI lets you know when you're logged in as an administrator by making the Command Box Blue with Yellow borders, and indicating "ADMIN_MODE" at the bottom.
The "Admin Mode" is giving special access to lab managers in real life to manage the makerspace facilities, such as adding, removing or changing the status.

====
* Prints are always displayed in order with `ONGOING` prints at the top, followed by `QUEUED`, then `requestDelete` or `CANCELLED` or `FINISHED`.
.  Some example commands you can warm up with:

* *`listMachines`* : lists all machines
* **`addJob`**`n/iDCP m/Ultimaker on/TIAN YUAN pr/HIGH d/1.5 jn/This is for the iDCP project t/iDCP` :
adds a Job named `iDCP` to the printer named `Ultimaker` with the owner named `TIAN YUAN` to the MakerManager. `jn/` and `t/` stand for job notes and tags, respectively.
* **`manageJob`**`iDCP start` : starts a Job named `iDCP`
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
Loading Sample Data (Optional)
====
// tag::sampleDataLoad[]

. Download `DemoDataV1.4.zip` (You can find it in the root directory of the repository link:{repoURL}[here])
. Unzip (using WinRar or 7Zip, for example) and move the 3 `xml` files in the folder named `data` in which you ran the jar file on your computer.
. The 'data' file should contain the 3 files below:
... data/addressBook.xml
... data/makerManagerAdmins.xml
... data/makerManagerMachines.xml
. Restart MakerManager to see the sample data loaded. It should match the UI screenshots given above.

// end::sampleDataLoad[]

== Features
This section will help you understand everything you can do with MakerManager, and show you how to do them.

====
*Problems MakerManager Solves*
====
We need to agree on some terms before you can navigate the User Guide properly.
MakerSpaces have various 'machines'. Each machine can have a queue of 'jobs'. Each queue can have only 1 'ongoing' job that is being processed.
Each machine has a name, each job has a name, and both have extra information attached for ease of use.

The problem makerspaces have today is the uncertainty when multiple people try to use the limited number of expensive machines for different tasks of different duration.
One job can take hours, and you might come back later only to find that you missed your change by a minute and someone present has the machine busy for a few more hours.
This can be extremely frustrating for you the user. Lab managers have tried using a time-sheet, but it hasn't been very effective. MakerManager tries to streamline these processes.

Now that you know what we're trying to achieve, you will hopefully understand why we've included some features.

====
*Using the Examples in this Guide*
====
The examples in this guide are formatted with the following conventions:

* Arguments in square brackets [ ] are optional
* Arguments in angle brackets < > are admin only
* All other arguments are required for a valid command execution
* Every argument may be subject to further validation by the parser before execution. Users will get feedback if the input is not conforming to rules.
* Words in upper-case are parameters supplied by you

====
*What You Can Do with MakerManager*
====
For the following commands, you can execute them by typing the example in the Command Box and pressing kbd:[Enter].
Under each command, we use the following order: what it does, outcome you get, any special notes.
[NOTE]
If any particular outcome is not listed, it implies that only a message will be shown pertaining to the output. +

[NOTE]
The words 'Print', 'Job' and 'Print Job' are used interchangeably. This app now specializes in 3D Prints, but can be extended to other equipments in the future.

* *Viewing Help* +
Provides a guidance as to what you can do with MakerManager. +
Outcome: You will see a window pop up with the user guide in it for quick reference. +

    Format: help

// tag::adminMode[]
* *Administrator mode* +
The administrator mode is present to prevent malicious users from harming other users' workflow easily. Only the administrator is allowed to make drastic changes to the application and its data. +
The commands listed below will only work in admin mode. The list is non-exhaustive, and you will find more admin-specific commands later on. +



.. *Login* +
Enables admin mode in MakerManager. +
Outcome: You get admin-privileges and the Command Box will turn blue. +
[NOTE]
A default account is created when no other admins exist. Username and Password of default are both 'admin'. +
[WARNING]
We strongly recommend adding a secure admin account and removing the default during your first run. +

    Format: login ADMIN_ID PASSWORD

	Example: login admin admin

.. *Logout (Admin Only)* +
Disables admin mode in MakerManager. This ensures that MakerManager is usable by both types of user in the same terminal, with the same UI. +
Outcome: The Command Box will return back to original color afterwards, and you will lose admin-privileges.

	Format: <logout>

.. *Add Admin (Admin Only)* +
Adds another admin to MakerManager. This enables makerspaces with multiple managers in-charge to collaborate easily. +
[NOTE]
PASSWORD has to match a specific validation criteria - namely at least: 1 upper-case letter, 1 lower-case letter, 1 number, 1 symbol from [@#$%^&+=] and 8 characters in total+

    Format: <addAdmin> USERNAME PASSWORD VERIFY_PASSWORD

    Example: addAdmin saif 123Abcd$ 123Abcd$

.. *Remove Admin (Admin Only)* +
Removes a specified admin from the MakerManager. This will let you remove an admin if (s)he is no longer granted these privileges in the makerspace, for whatever reason. +
Outcome: The ex-admin will no longer be able to login.
_If you remove your own account, you will be logged out automatically._ +

    Format: <removeAdmin> USERNAME

    Example: removeAdmin saif

.. *Update Admin Password (Admin Only)* +
Updates the logged in admin's password in MakerManager. You may want to change to a different password frequently, for good security practices. +
[NOTE]
NEW_PW has to match the same validation criteria as the one specified in addAdmin command. +

    Format: <updatePassword> USERNAME OLD_PW NEW_PW NEW_PW_VERIFY

    Example: updatePassword saif 123Abcd$ 456Wasd= 456Wasd=

// end::adminMode[]
// tag::addMachine[]

Adds a new machine to MakerManager. You might be extending your printer fleet by adding new printers, and this lets the users of the space know. Especially handy if it's a big place! +
Outcome: You will see a new column added to the UI. +
+
This command has the following constraints:
+
.. All machine names must be unique.
... Names should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces,
and it should not be blank.
... Reserved names are : `AUTO`
.. Status can only be
... “ENABLED”
... “DISABLED”

    Format: <addMachine> n/MACHINE_NAME ms/STATUS

    Example: addMachine n/myMachine ms/DISABLED

// end::addMachine[]

Outcome: You will see a change in the fields of the specific machine. +
_This command adhere to the same constraints as addMachine Command. +
At least one optional argument must be present. The argument(s) present will replace the respective values of the existing machine_ +
Machine status can be `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. +
[NOTE]
Machines with `ongoing` prints cannot be edited!


    Format: <editMachine> MACHINE_NAME [n/MACHINE_NAME] [ms/STATUS]

    Example: editMachine oldupbox n/newupbox ms/ENABLED

// end::editMachine[]

// tag::manageMachine[]
* *Manage machine (Admin only)* +
.. *Clean a Machine* +
Cleans a machine by removing jobs that have status `CANCELLED`, `FINISHED` or `DELETING`. This is a convenient and fast way for you to get things done. +
Outcome: The machine will no longer have any of these jobs listed afterwards, making it easier for others to view. +

    Format: <manageMachine> MACHINE_NAME clean

    Example: manageMachine Ultimaker clean

.. *Flush a Machine* +
Removes all the jobs from the specified machine. You will be warned and asked for confirmation, as it may hinder other users. +
Outcome: If you press OK, the machine's queue will be empty. If you press CANCEL, nothing happens. +
    _If you specify AUTO, the prints in the existing machine will be transferred to other machines optimally._ +

    Format: <manageMachine> MACHINE_NAME flush

    Examples:
    manageMachine oldupbox flush
    manageMachine oldupbox flush AUTO

.. *Remove a Machine* +
Removes a machine from MakerManager. This helps you decommission a machine and let users know instantly. +
Outcome: You will no longer see the machine as a column in the UI. +
[NOTE]
You can't do this unless the machine's queue is empty. +

    Format : <manageMachine> MACHINE_NAME remove

    Example: manageMachine oldupbox remove

* *Finding Machines:* +
Finds machines based on given keywords. You have to give at least 1 argument. +
Outcome: You will see only matching machines shown in the UI. +
[NOTE]
After the filtered machine list is displayed, use the `listMachines` command to return to the main menu. +

    Format: findMachine [MACHINE_NAME_1] [MACHINE_NAME_2]...

    Example: findMachine oldupbox mbot

// end::manageMachine[]

* *Listing Machines* +
Lists all the machines present in the makerspace. +
Outcome: All the queues will be visible in the UI. +

    Format: listMachines

    Example: listMachines

// tag::addJob[]
* *Add a Print Job* +
Adds a print job to a machine's queue in MakerManager. +
Outcome: You will see the job in if you scroll down the queue of the machine you specified. +
_Specifying `AUTO` as MACHINE_NAME will let the software optimize which queue to add the print to. +
Available priorities: `URGENT`, `HIGH`, `NORMAL`. +
Please note that `PRIORITY` is currently just a display feature aimed at helping the lab manager gain more information._ +
[NOTE]
Prints cannot be added to `disabled` Machines! +
Multiple tags can be added to one print job.

    Format: addJob n/PRINT_NAME m/MACHINE_NAME on/OWNER_NAME pr/PRIORITY d/DURATION(in hours) jn/NOTE [t/TAG]...

.. *Start a Print* +
Starts an existing print job, if it is at the top of the queue. +
Outcome: The print tag will be set to `ONGOING` and the machine will start a timer. The print will be automatically flagged as `FINISHED` after the time specified in the duration has passed. +
_If you want to get an urgent print done, but it is not at the top of the queue, please request lab manager's assistance._ +
[NOTE]
If `admin` mode is enabled, users are able to start jobs that are not at the top of the queue

    Format: manageJob/<manageJob> PRINT_NAME start

    Example: manageJob gears start

.. *Cancel a Print* +
Cancels an existing print in the queue. You might want to use this if the print fails, which is very common for 3D printers, or if you no longer want to print for whatever reason. +
Outcome: The print tag will be changed to `CANCELLED`. +

    Format: manageJob PRINT_NAME cancel

    Example: manageJob gears cancel


.. *Restarting a Print:*
Restarts an existing print in the queue. Same as start. This is be used after a failed(cancelled) print. +

    Format: manageJob PRINT_NAME restart

    Example: manageJob gears restart

.. *Delete a Print (Admin only)* +
Deletes an existing print in the queue. +
Outcome: You will no longer see the specified print in the UI. +

    Format: <manageJob> PRINT_NAME delete

    Example: manageJob gears delete


.. *Move a Print (Admin only)* +
Moves an existing print that is not `ONGOING` to another machine. This command inserts the print at the bottom of the target Machine's queue +
Outcome: Print is removed from its current Machine and added to the bottom of the queue of the target Machine. +
[NOTE]
Prints are always displayed sorted in order of `ONGOING`, followed by `QUEUED`, then
`requestDeletion` or `CANCELLED` or `FINISHED`.

    Format: <manageJob> PRINT_NAME move MACHINE_NAME

    Example: manageJob gears move ultimaker


.. *Shifting a Print (Admin only)* +

`requestDeletion` or `CANCELLED` or `FINISHED`.

    Format: <manageJob> PRINT_NAME swap TARGET_PRINT_NAME

    Example: manageJob gears swap cup

// end::manageJob[]

// tag::requestDeletion[]
* *Requests a print job to be deleted by admin* +
This command ensures that a malicious user cannot delete prints from a queue just so that (s)he can get the print done fast. +
Outcome: Marks a print with a `requestDeletion` tag, after which the admin might decide to remove it. +

    Format: requestDeletion n/PRINT_NAME

    Example: requestDeletion n/gears
