Welcome to _MakerManager_ Developer Guide!
MakerManager is a free, open-source, desktop application for managing time-shared equipment in makerspaces.
MakerManager aims to bridge a gap to let makers and managers coordinate effectively and efficiently - so you can worry less about availability and spend more time hacking!
MakerManager is meant for makers, and thus is optimized for people comfortable with a Command Line Interface (CLI).
Check out the User Guide to quickly see what MakerManager is capable of.

MakerManager is written in Java, under the Object-Oriented paradigm. There are lots of ways in which you can contribute to MakerManager: coding, testing, improving tools, or contributing to the documentation.
This guide provides information that will help you get started in your intended direction, and we hope you'll find it useful regardless of whether you're a new software developer, or an experienced hand. Some preveious experience in software engineering in Java is assumed.

Choose a topic from the Table of Contents below, to get an in-depth description of the inner workings of the application.

== Setting up
Follow the simple steps below to get up and running with the MakerManager application development process.

=== Prerequisites
You need to have the following software installed in your system before you can start the development process. Both the software might require sign-up procedures before you can download their installation file.

. *JDK `9`* or later +
You can use https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/install/toc.htm[this link] to help you install JDK.
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE +
You can use https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/install-and-set-up-product.html[this link] to help you install IntelliJ IDEA.
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

You now have the tools to dive into MakerManager's source code.

=== Setting up the project in your computer
To help you get the project into the development environment properly.

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

The build should end with a `BUILD PASSED` message.

=== Verifying the setup
If all is well, the following two steps should be trivial.

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Loading sample data (Recommended for first-timers)

. Download `DemoDataV1.4.zip` (You can find it in the root directory of the repository link:{repoURL}[here])
. Unzip (using WinRar or 7Zip, for example) and keep the `data` folder inside in the same directory as the jar file.
. The 'data' file should contain the 3 files below:
... data/addressBook.xml
... data/makerManagerAdmins.xml
... data/makerManagerMachines.xml
. Restart MakerManager to see the sample data loaded.

=== Configurations to do before writing code
Before you start messing around with the source code, here are some tools you might want to set up in order to tactfully handle a medium-sized project such as this.

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the `MakerManager` branding and refer to our upstream repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `MakerManager`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design
This section gives you a brief overview of the design of the app, including a look at the architecture and various other components. After reading this section, you should be able to
understand some of the design trade-offs made during the development of the application.

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture
This section is designed to illustrate and identify the abstracted view of the architecture used to implement MakerManager. This section also contains descriptions of the separate components and process view of the communication between said components.

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. The Architecture system for the MakerManager is Event-driven Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The User Interface (UI) of the application is what the user sees and interacts with.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor is the main driver of the program. It handles user input and reacts to them as needed.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: The Model holds the data of the Application in-memory. This is the central repository for all data.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: The Storage component reads data from, and writes data to, the non-volatile memory. This ensures our data is saved between sessions.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `addMachine n/ultimaker ms/ENABLED`.

.Component interactions for `addMachine n/ultimaker ms/ENABLED` command (part 1)
image::AddMachineExecution.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `MachineListChangedEvent` when the maker manager data is changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `addMachine n/ultimaker ms/ENABLED` command (part 2)
image::SaveMachineListChangedEventStorage.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiComponentClassDiagramV1.4.2.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `MachineListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a machine) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("addMachine ms/ultimaker n/ENABLED")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `addMachine n/ultimaker ms/ENABLED` Command

// tag::modelComponent[]
[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelComponentClassDiagramV1.4.3.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Admin>` that can be 'observed'
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Job>` that can be 'observed' in machines
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Machine>` that can be 'observed'
* eg. the UI can be bound to these 3 lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in any of the list changes.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

// end::modelComponent[]

// tag::storageComponent[]
[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageComponentClassDiagramCompleted.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* stores an initialized `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences derived from
JsonUserPrefsStorage
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in 2 separate xml format
** XmlSerializableMakerManagerAdmins
** XmlSerializableMakerManagerMachines
// end::storageComponent[]



[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
This section describes how undo/redo is implemented in MakerManager.

==== Current Implementation
[[versionedaddressbook]]
The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
For added security, `VersionedAddressBook` also remembers the last time the user was logged in or logged out using `lastAdminLoginPointer` and `lastAdminLogoutPointer` .
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#adminLoginCommit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history, updates lastAdminLoginPointer.
* `VersionedAddressBook#adminLogoutCommit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history, updates lastAdminLogoutPointer.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.
`lastAdminLoginPointer` and `lastAdminLogoutPointer` are initialised at -1, indicating that the MakerManager was never logged in or logged out.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `addJob n/iDCP..` command to add a Job to the MakerManager.
The `addJob` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `addJob n/iDCP..` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.
[NOTE]
If the command used was login or logout, the corresponding `Model#adminLoginCommitAddressBook()` or `Model#adminLogoutCommitAddressBook()` will be called. This command additionally updates the corresponding
`lastAdminLoginPointer` or `lastAdminLogoutPointer` to the current address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `manageJob iDCP start` to start the job iDCP. The `manageJob iDCP start` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that starting the job was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.
The `undo` command also checks if the user is attempting to undo a logout command by calling `Model#isUndoLogout()` and will return an error if this is the case.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.
The `redo` command also checks if the user is attempting to redo a login command by calling `Model#isRedoLogin()` and will return an error if this is the case.


Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `listJobs`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `listJobs`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`.
Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`,
all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because
it no longer makes sense to redo the `manageJob iDCP start` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.

// tag::fileStorageSystem[]
=== File Storage System for Maker Manager

This section will describe how Maker Manager reads and stores information in our local database
in https://whatis.techtarget.com/fileformat/XML-eXtensible-markup-language[XML] format.

[red]#The diagram below gives an overview on how Maker Manager stores its data.#

image::StorageComponentClassDiagramCompleted.png[width:800]

[red]#The diagram below shows how Maker Manager reads its data upon start up.#

image::StorageComponentLogicFlowDiagram.png[width:800]
. When Maker Manager is booted, storageManager will execute readAddressBook(UserPrefs)
where UserPrefs contains the file paths for each separate xml data file :
.. makerManagerMachines.xml
.. makerManagerAdmins.xml
. XmlAddressBookStorage will then attempt to read each file path sequentially through XmlFileStorage.
XmlFileStorage will then call a utility function from a class called XmlUtil which will load
the appropriate data and its corresponding file format. It will then marshall the data into a java object
of the format in which it was called with
. It will then send this java object back to address book storage which will call the toModelType() function
from each XmlSerializableClass back to storage manager as a new address book containing the respective data from the xml files
in their correct maker manager java objects.(See <<versionedaddressbook>>)
// end::fileStorageSystem[]

// tag::administratormode[]
=== Administrator Mode
This section describes how MakerManager builds a layer of security around critical data and restricts manipulation of such sensitive
information to respective administrators/managers of individual makerspaces.

==== Current Implementation
The implementation of the administrator mode spans mainly the `Logic` and `Model` components, but also relies on the `Storage` component.
For better User-Experience, we also make small changes to `Events` and `UI` components in the architecture.

The following commands are directly related to admins:
login, logout, addAdmin, removeAdmin and updatePassword

Our admin mode accommodates multiple admins, and ensures that there is at least one admin present.
The admins are stored in a `UniqueAdminList()` in `versionedAddressBook`, with their usernames and passwords being
securely stored in-Memory and in-file (for persistence).

[NOTE]
See `File Storage` section for relevant storage part, `Model Component` for `Admin` class model and the `Password Encryption`
section for the discussion pertaining to the encryption.

The two different access types are implemented with the help of an AdminSession object inside versionedAddressBook.
This Object keeps track of whether someone is logged in, and if so, who is. The AdminSession object has the following methods for us to use:

* setLogin() - gives admin privileges to the current user
* clearLogin() - strips admin privileges of the current user
* isAdminLoggedIn() - returns a boolean saying whether we are in admin mode
* getLoggedInAdmin() - returns reference to the admin currently logged in

[red]#The diagram below shows the admin-related section of the Model.#

image::AdminModelClassDiagram.png[width:800]

The following sequence diagram for login also applies to logout. We include this because it demonstrates how AdminSessions is used as well.

[red]#The diagram below illustrates the sequence diagram for login.#

image::SDforLogin.png[width:800]

We can then use AdminSession to know whether an admin is logged in, before authorizing use of a command.

[red]#The simple activity diagram below demonstrates a common use case.#

image::ActivityDiagramForAdminCommand.png[width:800]

==== Design Consideration
The team debated on whether we should use a Singleton or not. We later decided not to use a Singleton since:
. Singletons increase coupling
. The system and the tests were already implemented without a singleton, and changing did not give any major pros.

// end::administratormode[]

// tag::dataencryption[]

=== Password Encryption
This section describes how MakerManager makes sure the administrator passwords are kept secure.

==== Current Implementation
The password is encrypted using salting and hashing. The low-level implementation of this is handled by the popular open
source library jBcrypt. The library was chosen for having a fairly simple API for generating hashes and comparing
passwords to stored hashes. The only two static methods used from the API were:

. Bcrypt.hashPW() - generates an encrypted string from the raw text password
. Bcrypt.checkPW() - verifies given password with stored hash

Other than this, we also enforce password validation to make sure a moderately strong password is chosen by the admin when signing up.
The implementation restricts itself to the `Logic` component of the architecture.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Where to encrypt
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Encrypt it as it is being added to in-Memory address book.
** Pros: Hashing needs to be done only once, after going through ModelManager. Storage Manager does not change. Able to do password validation and prevent unnecessary computations.
** Cons: The password information is unprotected as it passes through UI and Logic.
* **Alternative 2:** Encrypt it in UI
** Pros: More secure transfer of passwords through the pipeline.
** Cons: UI is heavy, and may become slower if hashing is too taxing on the system.

// end::dataencryption[]

// tag::managejob[]
=== Managing Prints
This section describes how MakerManager manages the Jobs or Prints within the makerspace.
More specifically, this section will detail the implementation of the manageJob command and
its various sub-features.


The main command to manage and manipulate the Jobs in the makerManager
is `manageJob` which has the following subcommands:

* `start` - sets the status of a job to "ONGOING"
* `restart` - sets the status of a job to "ONGOING", functionally the same as start, but used for restarting cancelled Jobs.
* `cancel` - sets the status of a job to "CANCELLED"
* `remove` - removes the Job from the Maker Manager
* `swap` - Swaps the position of two Jobs
* `move` - Moves a Job to another Machine
* `shift` - Shift a Job's order within a machine

The syntax for the commands are implemented in the following manner: +

*manageJob <Jobname> subcommand <operand2>* +

The subcommands `start`, `restart` and `cancel` do not make use of *<operand2>*, whereas the subcommands
`swap` `move` and `shift` require
require *<operand2>* to specify target Job for `swap`, Machine for `move`, and up/down for `shift`.

We have nested these commands as subcommands of `manageJob` to centralise the management of Jobs for users, therefore making it
easier for users to manipulate Jobs.

==== Current Implementation

Our MakerManager keeps a record of all Jobs or Prints in a makerspace distributed across many machines.
Within each `Machine`, Jobs are stored within a `uniqueJobsList`. The `Machines` are in turn stored in a
`UniqueMachineList` in the `VersionedAddressBook`. The manipulation of the order and the content of the is facilitated by the `ModelManager`, which exposes the methods
implemented by the `VersionedAddressBook`.

[red]#The diagram below shows the Jobs related section of the Model.#

image::JobsClassDiagram.png[width:800]

There are three main types of methods in `VersionedAddressBook` that concern
the manipulation of Jobs:

    * *Lookup Methods* that return a handle to a Job or Machine:
    ** findJob()
    ** findMachine()

These Methods are used to obtain a handle a particular Job or Machine using each's classes name property. All Jobs
must have a unique name, and all Machines must also have a unique name. findJob() returns both a Job and its parent
Machine as a `JobMachineTuple`, a utility class container object that contains a Job and a Machine.

* Methods that *mutate Jobs*:
** startJob()
** cancelJob()
** restartJob()

The sequence diagram for these methods are very similar, they follow a similar pathway and mutate the
same property in Job. We will therefore only detail the sequence diagram of startJob().

[red]#The following diagram shows the sequence diagram for startJob().#

image::SDStartJob.png[width:800]

* Methods that mutates the UniqueJobList within a Machine:
** swapJobs()
** moveJob()
** shiftJob()


Much like before, the sequence diagram for these methods are very similar, but will call
methods from the UniqueJobsList as well.

Therefore, we can use the manageJob command to manipulate the prints Jobs to
achieve a representation of the actual prints in the makerspace. This can be illustrated
in the simple activity Diagram below.

[red]#The following diagram shows the generic activity diagram for a managing a Job.#

image::ADManagePrints.PNG[width:800]

The generic flow of a typical manageJob command is as follows:

. User enters a manageJob command
. The method associated with its subcommand will be called.
. Lookup methods findJob() / findMachine() will be called to obtain a handle on the target Job or Machine.
If the these methods do not find the Job / Machine with the correct unique identifier (name), an Exception will be raised.
. If the handles are found, then the appropriate action will be taken.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Direct Mutation of Objects (Jobs and Machines)
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** mutate object's data fields directly.
** Pros: No new objects have to be created, therefore saving unnecessary computations since only the required
data fields are changed.
** Cons: Objects are mutable. Additional care needs to be taken in ensuring that these objects are accessed defensively
by methods that might cause unintended mutation. Additionally, mutation events must be flagged and raised, since they
mutations within the Objects are not observed by its container.
* **Alternative 2:** Create a new instance with edited fields
** Pros: Defensive. Objects will never mutate, therefore there is no chance of unintended or illegal mutation. Changes
observed by Observable Containers since a new object is created/added.
** Cons: More computationally intensive, commands will take longer to execute. Also less room for extension since
performance is now inversely proportional to object size.


// end::managejob[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation
For any software, documentation is a must. In this project we maintain a developer guide and a user guide. The developer guide is mainly focused on letting people like you ease into
development and maintenance of the software. The user guide is for clients trying to use the functionality we enable.

As you can see, documentation is non-trivial and of utmost importance. We write this section for encouraging good documentation practices, even in agile teams like ours.

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.

====

[[Testing]]
== Testing
Testing your program is an essential part of the development cycle. Testing ensures the correctness, functionality and usability of the app at every step of the way.
This will help you catch regression bugs immediately and fix them with considerably much less hassle.

This section helps you discover, run and write tests for effective development.

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops
This section will lay out the tools we used to make the development process easier and more fun. These tools were designed for efficient building, automated testing and deployment of releases
in an agile team.

=== Build Automation
Build automation refers to the process of compiling, packaging and testing a piece of software automatically.
We use `Gradle` for this purpose. See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of automating the build and testing of code every time someone commits to the repository.
This is a best-practice in the industry, as it helps isolated team members coordinate development efforts without a big hassle.

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting
Test coverage is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code is executed when the test suite is executed.
We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release
You would want to make an official release of your application when there is a usable product, which is significantly more capable/better than the previous release, if any.
Regular releases are also an essential component of any agile team. This section teaches you how to create a new release.

Here are the steps:

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, MakerManager depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives: +

a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)

[appendix]
== Product Scope

*Target user profile:***
**There will be two categories of users for the app. The main user will be students using the makerspace. The second user will be the lab manager.

* has a need to manage a significant number shared devices (lab manager)
* has a need to prioritize and queue certain print jobs over others (lab manager)
* has a need to look up when certain devices will be free for use (students)
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing over mouse input
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

*Value proposition*: see 3D printers are being used, and the estimated time left until the equipment will be free. This will reduce system loss and increase the efficiency of all parties involved.

[appendix]
== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

Testers are encouraged to follow the testing codes sequentially.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

    .. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
    .. Download the data files by downloading the DemoDataV1.4.zip from the root.
    .. Unzip and save the data files in a folder called 'data' in the same directoryin which you saved the jar file on your computer.

 The 'data' file should contain the 3 files below.
 data/addressBook.xml
 data/makerManagerAdmins.xml
 data/makerManagerMachines.xml

    .. Double-click the jar file

    Expected view:
    Shows the GUI with a list of printers displayed horizontally where each column represents a printer with print jobs assigned to it.
    These printers are already pre-added to the maker manager local database.
    The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

    .. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
    .. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
    Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

. Leaving the app:

    .. Enter the command:

    exit

    .. The window shall close automatically.

=== Ease of use
. Test case: help window activation

    help

    Expected:
    A pop-up window containing the user guide will be displayed.

// end::testingCase[]

=== Managing the admin access
. Test case: login to a default admin account

    login admin admin

    Expected:
    The command box will turn to be blue. Message "login success!" will be shown. Label "[ADMIN_MODE]" will be displayed at the bottom of the app.

    Failing Variations:
        - Wrong password
        - Wrong username

. Test case: add an admin to the system (admin only)

    addAdmin saif aaaAAA123$ aaaAAA123$

    Expected:
    Message "New admin added successfully!" will be shown.

    Failing Variations:
        - Password too simple, and does not meet requirements

. Test case: add an admin which is already in the system, judged by username (admin only)

    addAdmin saif aaaAAA123$ aaaAAA123$

    Expected:
    The command will not work because there is existing a user admin "saif". Message "This username already exists. Try a new one or login." will be shown.

. Test case: Passwords don't match when adding an admin (admin only)

    addAdmin newAdmin aaaAAA123$ aaaAAA123

    Expected:
    The command will not work because the verification password (entered the second time) does not match first entry. Message "The two password fields don't match! Please try again." will be shown.

. Test case: update password of logged in admin

    updatePassword admin admin betterPassword123$ betterPassword123$

    Expected: Message "Your password has been changed successfully!" shown.

    Failing Variations:
        - trying to update password of "saif" when logged in as "admin". You can only update your own password
        - Wrong old password
        - Not adhering to password constraints given on top

. Test case: remove the currently logged in admin (logged in as "admin" only)

    removeAdmin admin

    Expected:
    Message "Admin removed successfully!" will be shown, indicating the "admin" is already moved from the system.
    The command box will turn back to black and the "[ADMIN_MODE]" label will disappear because "admin" is the currently logged in administrator. Removing the currently logged in administrator will log out that one automatically.

    Failing Variations:
        - Admin to be removed not present in system
        - Admin to be removed is the last admin in the system.

. Test case: login to a admin account which is recently added

    login saif aaaAAA123$

    Expected:
    The command box will turn to be blue. Message "login success!" will be shown. Label "[ADMIN_MODE]" will be displayed at the bottom of the app.

. Test case: exit from the admin mode (admin only)

    logout

    Expected:
    Message "Admin removed successfully!" will be shown, indicating the "saif" is already moved from the system.
    The command box will turn back to black and the "[ADMIN_MODE]" label will disappear.
